# GoogleCloud-ML-for-Trading
Notes and exercises for [Machine Learning for Trading Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-trading) Offered by Google Cloud and New York Institute of Finance on Coursera.

## About
This Specialization is for finance professionals, including but not limited to: hedge fund traders, analysts, day traders, those involved in investment management or portfolio management, and anyone interested in gaining greater knowledge of how to construct effective trading strategies using Machine Learning. Alternatively, this specialization can be for machine learning professionals who seek to apply their craft to quantitative trading strategies. 

The courses will teach you how to create various trading strategies using Python. By the end of the Specialization, you will be able to create long-term trading strategies, short-term trading strategies, and hedging strategies.



To successfully complete the exercises within the program, you should have advanced competency in Python programming and familiarity with pertinent libraries for Machine Learning, such as Scikit-Learn, StatsModels, and Pandas; a solid background in ML and statistics (including regression, classification, and basic statistical concepts) and basic knowledge of financial markets (equities, bonds, derivatives, market structure, and hedging). Experience with SQL is recommended.
